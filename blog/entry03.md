#### _Organization_ and _Communcation_

My first skill that i learnd during the part A and the beggining of part B 
1. First was **_organization_** - After we did list of hardware and softwere we needed to organizie it and during this i learned how to divide things on topics, break them down into parts  to make it more easier to find something or add something to this list. I realesed that it might help me in the future to make my work faster because of the right organization, like my freedom project which is already started.
2. The second one was **_Communication_** - After i changed my seat, my communication with a partner got much better because we actually talk and help eachother and it helps me learn new things CLI better. I am not scared of asking for help and open to help other person if i can, i learned that you just need to be respectful, kind and not be scared of talking and asking for help.
