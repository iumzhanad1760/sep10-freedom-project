## Content
My topic is a **Graphic design** and in this entry i will write about what we did in the last few weeks. So after hardware and software in entry02 we organized it all by topics and wrote new ideas about future technologies. My ideas was those below, and also for each of them theres a details. 
#### Non physical graphic design tool 
- You can draw in the air using specific glasses
- Could save it and upload on computer 
- Specific pen and finger with specific glove can be used to draw 
- Can save it through glasses 
#### 3d design with vr glasses 
- Using vr glasses and gloves can draw and make something in the air 
- After making can make it 3d 
- After making something can touch it and move it with gloves like it is a subject
- On display may choose colors and textures
- Things may start moving
##### Chip for body to make all these things above but without any physical tools technologies.
- Chip is going to insert in the body, brain to make you see objects and screens like in the phone or computer.
- There will be no need of vr glasses or gloves 
- Can turn on and off different Ã pps 
- Apps going to hide somewhere on the side of all you can see
- Can hide all apps with one button to make your view clear.


## Sources
For my sources i used the same links as from my Entry 2, those were software and hardware websites. First one was [The best graphc design software](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-graphic-design-software)- which told about what are the best apps and websites  to use. Also there was [Graphic design tools](https://www.designity.com/blog/the-best-graphic-design-tools-every-designer-needs) website that told us some good devices for graphic design like apple macbooks and couples samsung and lenovo comuters. 
## Engineering Design Process
Right now i am on stage 3 - Brainstorming and writing new ideas. On this stage i was brainstorming my topic searching and making some new ideas for the _future technologies_ that not yet made. And the problem i am trying to solve is non physical technologies that will allow people draw and create new things. 

## Skills
#### _Organization_ and _Communcation_

My first skill that i learnd during the part A and the beggining of part B 
1. First was **_organization_** - After we did list of hardware and softwere we needed to organizie it and during this i learned how to divide things on topics, break them down into parts  to make it more easier to find something or add something to this list. I realesed that it might help me in the future to make my work faster because of the right organization, like my freedom project which is already started.
2. The second one was **_Communication_** - After i changed my seat, my communication with a partner got much better because we actually talk and help eachother and it helps me learn new things CLI better. I am not scared of asking for help and open to help other person if i can, i learned that you just need to be respectful, kind and not be scared of talking and asking for help.
   
## Next steps
For the next steps i will move on on stage four which is **Plan***- the most promisimg solution. I am thinking about what can be createdto solve my problem and it would be very great to move on to the next entries, can't wait to start it.
