# How i chose on my Topic
#### The topic I decided on for this project is Graphic Design due to the fact that Iâ€™ve always been passionate about this subject. Since I met it in 5th grade and i got really insired by this subject, This topic was the first thought that i would want to try to find a new way to incorporate technology. I almost considered making this project about sports and especially Volleybal but I soon decided that Graphic Design would be the best choice, because it closely related to computer science and SEP. I found out that its really enjoyable to learn all those websites and here are the best of them ["What is the Graphic design"](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/graphic-design?srsltid=AfmBOooGdGl_hxuEWQctHmF2Lk40NwR-ytMFHQ8KRHTSNejMsEr3Dqlt) by the Interaction Design Foundation and ["What Is Graphic Design? A Beginner's Guide to This Creative Career"](https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/design/blog/what-is-graphic-design/) by the Ramussen University.
