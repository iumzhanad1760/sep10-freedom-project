# How i chose on my Topic
 The topic I decided on for this project is Graphic Design due to the fact that I’ve always been passionate about this subject. Since I met it in 5th grade and i got really insired by this subject, This topic was the first thought that i would want to try to find a new way to incorporate technology. I almost considered making this project about sports and especially Volleybal but I soon decided that Graphic Design would be the best choice, because it closely related to computer science and SEP. I found out that its really enjoyable to learn all those websites and here are the best of them ["What is the Graphic design"](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/graphic-design?srsltid=AfmBOooGdGl_hxuEWQctHmF2Lk40NwR-ytMFHQ8KRHTSNejMsEr3Dqlt) by the Interaction Design Foundation and ["What Is Graphic Design? A Beginner's Guide to This Creative Career"](https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/design/blog/what-is-graphic-design/) by the Ramussen University.

 ## Engineering Design Process

 I'm currently in really beggining of my project and have only decided my topic but i already know what my website will be about. There's a program that i'm going to solve and it's a fact that i'm want to show people that Graphic design is not boring thing and that it may be very colorful intersting and joyful!

 ## Skills

My current skills that i have learned during the research are **time managment** and **how to google and find topics i need**

### Time management

These are really important during any projects or assignments you need to **prioratize** work. It means that i need to do my work first and then everithing else like my phone, and i also think that you need to divide your work to a parts and give your brain and body rest. Always turn your work on time and if you did late than text your teacher about it and maybe ask for more time.

### How to Google

When i first searched _Graphic Design_ It gave me many different websites and i needed to chose the best. The one thing i founded out while searching is that i need to _specify_ for this one i was using the **Quotation Marks (” “)**  that helps google to make sites more specific than if i would not do it. Also i learned that Use a **minus sign** to exclude words that also helps specify.

# Next Steps

I would follow next steps of _Engineering Design Process_, my next one is Research and Brainstorm possible solutions!!
