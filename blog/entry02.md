# Skills 
While writing Entry 2 i develop skills of **googling** and **time managment**
## 1.
I tried to find the best devices and best websites for this entry so i improved those skills, when i was **googling things** i used parantasies for the keywords that google had ignored for example when i was searching ¨what hardware are the best for web and graphic design?¨ it was giving me devices or only about one subject either grapic design or web so i putted it in parantasize and it gave me more spesific information that i needed
## 2.
A second one is **time managment**, From the last one and this entry i learnd that i need to do work on time and not on the last second. When you have enough time for yoyur work you better and deeper into something you doing and doing it for skills and not just for the grade. Last time i forgot to do my work and did not went into my writing and at the end got grade that i was not really happy with but now i am tying really hard to improve my writing and those two skills.

## Do next?
